Namma Mysuru gives information about the Eat-Out (hotels, mess and restaurants), places to visit in and around Mysore and 
about the movies being screened in theaters of Mysore. 

Details about movie such as trailer, wiki page, poster etc.., are provided within app. 

Navigation to the places are provided through in-build Google Map app.
